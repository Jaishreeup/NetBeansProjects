RESEARCH
I work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods to different domains. I have been working with Natural Language Processing of Indian languages, information retrieval and recommendation systems and text mining applications. I am interested in using Machine learning methods to tasks related to climate modelling and prediction. I have been interested in doing analytics of mobility data. We have been working on applications in the domain of transportation and logistics.

RESEARCH
My research interests lie broadly in the area of distributed systems and networks.&nbsp; Some of the problems I have worked on in recent times include coverage in wireless sensor networks, event and data dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks, and desgning algorithms for time-varying graphs that can model many dynamic network scenarios. Recently, I have also been interested in scheduling and coordination problems that exist in smart grids, where I have worked on the problem of&nbsp; charge scheduling of electric vehicles in smart grids.

RESEARCH
My research interest revolves around different aspects of networks, ranging from social networks to smartphone devices. In the social network context, we focus on the different online, location based and event based social network datasets and investigate the influence of information diffusion on the popularity of different stakeholders such as tweet, businesses and groups. In the mobile context, we leverage on the user&rsquo;s smartphone engagement to recognize her physical activities, group activities as well as to detect the emotional state of the user.

RESEARCH
We are interested in realizing the biological phenomenon thourgh computational and experimental techniques. The focus is on developing new computational algorithms and tools for biological and clinical investigators. 

Protein Interaction Modeling: The correct biological association of a protein molecule with another is the key to understand the function of a protein complex. We aim to develop efficient and effective computational methods to predict protein interaction as an alternative of experimental methods like X-Ray crystallography or NMR. 

Protein Interaction Network: Designing or modeling the function of a protein at the macromolecular level is incomplete without a wholistic view of the total interaction map. Representing a protein as a vertex and their interaction as an edge of the graph we develop methods to infer the role of a protein from global perspective.

RESEARCH
Program source code is not amenable to efficient processing. Consequently, various types of modes of program such as dependency model, flow model, state model, interaction model, etc. can be extracted from source code. Of course, the models would differ in their syntax and sematics for different programming paradigms sporting different programming features and concurrency. Once a suitable program model has been defined, it is used for various software engineering tasks such as test coverage analysis, test case generation, regression test case selection, test prioritixation, optimization, fault-localization, etc.

RESEARCH
My current research encompasses the design of approximation algorithms for (i) computing diffuse reflection paths in polygons,&nbsp; and (ii) computing vertex guard sets for guarding polygons. I am also working on estimating bounds on the sizes of separating and bisecting families for set systems (hypergraphs).

RESEARCH
I work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods to different domains. I have been working with Natural Language Processing of Indian languages, information retrieval and recommendation systems and text mining applications. I am interested in using Machine learning methods to tasks related to climate modelling and prediction. I have been interested in doing analytics of mobility data. We have been working on applications in the domain of transportation and logistics.
